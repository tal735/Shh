# Shh

A chat messaging application written (and still being written) in JAVA, both client and server sides. 

The purpose of this app is to allow private chatting (hence the name 'Shh..').

Communication between clients works (I'm actually using it myself :]).

This is an ONGOING project, further changes/additions/fixes will be implemented, depends on how much free time I have.

Could it be better? Yes. However I'm doing it for my own amusement.

TODO:
1. Store data on database using Hibernate
2. Update availability status icon (online/offline) at client's contact list.
3. Access Control of requests sent to server (prevent disguised requests as being sent by another user).
4. A 'Search' form for current users in the system.
5. Remove contact from friend's list.
6. Ability to send messages when target contact is offline, and him receiving the messages once he is online.
7. Encrypt messages end-to-end.
8. Personalization (Window colors, etc..)
9. Enhance contact profile (Avatar, more fields)
