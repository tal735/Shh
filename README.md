# Shh

A chat application written in JAVA, both client and server sides.

Since it's supposed to be a private chat (hence the name 'Shh..') there is no registeration form (user definitions are made on server side at the moment). Instead, an admin form will be in use in the future.

Communication between clients works.

This is an ONGOING, further changes/additions/fixes will be implemented.
